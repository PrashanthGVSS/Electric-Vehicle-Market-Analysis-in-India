Step 1: Data Import and Preprocessing
------Import the dataset into MySQL for initial querying and exploration.
------Load tables for electric vehicle sales by maker, sales by state, and the date dimension table.
------Ensure relationships between tables are correctly set for analysis.

Step 2: SQL Analysis
------Write SQL queries to extract key data points for each task:
-------Total sales for each fiscal year.
-------Top and bottom makers based on sales volume for 2-wheelers.
-------State-wise penetration rates for EVs.

Step 3: Calculating Key Metrics
------Use DAX measures in Power BI to calculate important KPIs like:
------Total EV Sales (for both 2-wheelers and 4-wheelers).
------CAGR for top makers and states.
------Penetration rates for each year.
------Revenue growth from 2022 to 2024.

Step 4: Visualization and Dashboard Creation
------Create visualizations in Power BI:
------Use KPI cards for key metrics like total EV sales, CAGR, and penetration rates.
------Build line charts for quarterly sales trends and bar charts for top states.
------Create a map visualization for geographical insights on EV penetration.

Step 5: Forecasting Future Sales
------Use historical data and CAGR to project EV sales for 2030 for the top 10 states.
------Forecast future trends based on growth patterns observed in the 2022â€“2024 period.
